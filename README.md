# EduMama - Landing Page (MVP)

## What this creates
- index.html (complete landing page)
- css/style.css (styles)
- images/ (placeholder folder; put hero and favicon images here)

## Quick preview
Open `index.html` in a browser or use VS Code Live Server.

## How the form works (MVP)
- The sign-up form opens a prefilled email (mailto:) addressed to info@edumama.org.
- It also downloads a small JSON file containing the submission data for local archiving.

## Hosting
- Recommended: Push this folder to GitHub and enable GitHub Pages (main branch, root).
- Or use free builders (Dorik, Renderforest, etc.) if you want a drag-and-drop builder.

## Next steps you might want:
- Add real images to images/ (hero-placeholder.jpg, favicon.png)
- Wire the form to a Google Form, Airtable, or a small server to collect submissions centrally.
- Add analytics and SEO meta tags.
